With a user-friendly interface, real-time predictions, and comprehensive property data, this app is your tool for navigating the real estate market efficiently and effectively.

## Model Development Process
In our project to predict house prices in Toronto, we followed a systematic approach to evaluate and optimize the performance of various machine learning models. Below is a detailed explanation of the process and results obtained at each stage:

### 1. Baseline Model: XGBoost
**Model Overview:** We started with the XGBoost algorithm, a robust gradient boosting model known for its high performance in structured data tasks.

**Performance:**
- Accuracy: 64%
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 19%

**Insights:** The baseline results provided a strong foundation, highlighting the need for feature optimization to improve accuracy and reduce error.

### 2. Feature Selection Using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
**Methodology:** RFE was applied to identify the most significant features from the dataset. Out of the 25 initial features, 14 were selected based on their contribution to the model's predictive performance.

**Performance After RFE:**
- Accuracy: Slight improvement to 65%
- MAE: Increased slightly to 20%

**Insights:** Feature reduction streamlined the model, but further refinement was needed to improve prediction accuracy and minimize error.

### 3. Support Vector Regression (SVR)
**Model Overview:** SVR was tested to evaluate its performance on the dataset, particularly its ability to handle non-linear relationships.

**Performance:**
- MAE: 0.63

**Insights:** While SVR demonstrated promising results, it was not chosen as the final model due to its relatively higher error compared to other techniques.

### 4. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
**Model Overview:** KNN was implemented to assess its performance on predicting house prices by considering the similarity between neighboring data points.

**Performance:**
- MAE: 0.31

**Insights:** KNN performed reasonably well; however, it was sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters and did not outperform the final model.

### 5. Final Model: CatBoost
**Model Overview:** CatBoost was selected as the final model due to its ability to handle categorical features efficiently and deliver high performance with minimal parameter tuning.

**Performance:**
- MAE: 0.20

**Insights:** CatBoost achieved the lowest error among all tested models, making it the most suitable choice for our house price prediction task.
